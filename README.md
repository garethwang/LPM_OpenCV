# LPM: Locality Preserving Matching

A simple c++ implementation of the LPM algorithm. 

## Description

- A c++ implementation of the LPM algorithm.
- The code is based on the MATLAB implementation of [LPM](https://github.com/jiayi-ma/LPM) written by Jiayi Ma. 
- The k-d tree library(kdtree.h) is written by  [gishi523](https://github.com/gishi523/kd-tree), which is used to perform the K-nearest neighbor search.

## Requirement

- OpenCV
